    <p class="discription1">IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify devices on a network.
    
    IPv4 addresses are composed of four sets of numbers ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods.
    
    There are approximately 4.3 billion unique IPv4 addresses available.
    
    Each device connected to the internet requires a unique IPv4 address to communicate and exchange data.
    
    IPv4 addresses are gradually being supplemented by IPv6 addresses to meet the growing demand for internet-connected
    devices.

    the generator will produce a set of five unique IPv4 addresses</p>
