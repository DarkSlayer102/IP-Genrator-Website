    <p class="discription1">IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol that serves as the foundation for
    communication on the internet. It replaces IPv4 and introduces a significantly larger address space, allowing for an
    enormous number of unique IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are represented in a hexadecimal format and consist of eight
    groups separated by colons. This protocol was developed to address the depletion of IPv4 addresses and provides improved
    security, better network auto-configuration, and support for new internet-connected devices.
    </p>

    <p class="how_to_use_ipv6">Please specify the desired quantity of IP addresses you would like to generate. For instance,
        if you enter the number 5,
        the generator will produce a set of five unique IPv6 addresses</p>
