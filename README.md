# IP-Genrator-Website
The project aims to develop a web application using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate random IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The application will provide a user-friendly interface where users can specify the desired quantity of IP addresses they want to generate.



Install Django: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Open your command line interface and run the following command to install Django using pip:

<h1>pip install Django</h1>

Navigate to the project directory: Change to the project directory you just created using the cd command. For example:

cd projectname

Start the development server: Run the following command to start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

Verify the setup: Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Django default page, indicating that the development server is running.
